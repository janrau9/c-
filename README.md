# 42 Helsinki - C++ Modules

This repository contains my journey through the 42 coding school projects focused on learning and mastering the C++ programming language. From starting with no prior knowledge of C++, these modules provided a challenging yet rewarding pathway to understanding the language, its paradigms, and its application to real-world problems.

## Objectives
The primary goal of these modules was to provide hands-on exercises that accelerated learning and fostered a deeper understanding of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- The nuances of the C++ language
- Building complex, maintainable, and efficient systems from scratch

These modules helped me develop a disciplined coding style while adhering to industry standards like SOLID principles.

## Modules Overview

### Module 00: Introduction to C++
**Topics Covered**:
- Namespaces, standard I/O streams
- Class and instance fundamentals
- Member attributes and functions, visibility
- `this` pointer and initialization lists
- `const` correctness
- Accessors, comparisons, and pointers to members

**Reflections**:  
This module laid the foundation for understanding how C++ manages classes and objects, setting the stage for future projects.

---

### Module 01: Memory Management and References
**Topics Covered**:
- Dynamic memory allocation with `new` and `delete`
- References and their usage
- Filestreams for input/output

**Reflections**:  
Learning to manage memory effectively was challenging but crucial for understanding how C++ handles resources.

---

### Module 02: Operator Overloading and Polymorphism
**Topics Covered**:
- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- Operator overloading for custom behavior
- Canonical form and best practices

**Reflections**:  
This module introduced the flexibility of C++ through operator overloading, enhancing code readability and functionality.

---

### Module 03: Inheritance in C++
**Topics Covered**:
- Basics of inheritance and its application to class hierarchies

**Reflections**:  
Inheritance introduced the concept of code reuse and the power of organizing functionality in a hierarchical structure.

---

### Module 04: Abstract Classes and Subtyping Polymorphism
**Topics Covered**:
- Abstract classes and their role in defining interfaces
- Subtyping polymorphism for dynamic behavior

**Reflections**:  
This module deepened my understanding of designing extensible systems and adhering to OOP principles.

---

### Module 05: Nested Classes and Exceptions
**Topics Covered**:
- Nested classes and their encapsulation benefits
- Exception handling for robust error management

**Reflections**:  
Mastering exceptions reinforced the importance of writing resilient code that can handle unexpected situations.

---

### Module 06: Type Casting in C++
**Topics Covered**:
- Type conversion and reinterpretation from C
- Upcasting and downcasting
- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `const_cast`
- The `explicit` keyword for constructor behavior

**Reflections**:  
This module clarified the intricacies of type safety and the various mechanisms C++ offers for type manipulation.

---

### Module 07: Templates and Parametric Programming
**Topics Covered**:
- Templates for generic programming
- Default types and specialization
- Parametric macros from C

**Reflections**:  
Templates unlocked the potential for reusable and type-agnostic code, paving the way for efficient programming.

---

### Modules 08 & 09: Standard Template Library (STL)
**Topics Covered**:
- Comprehensive exploration of the STL
- Practical use cases for containers, iterators, and algorithms

**Reflections**:  
Mastering the STL was critical for writing efficient and compact code, especially in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features of the Journey

- **Challenging and Rewarding**: Learning C++ from scratch, along with its unique paradigms and concepts, made each module both daunting and fulfilling.
- **Hands-On Approach**: Every concept was reinforced by building code from scratch, making the learning process deeply practical.
- **Real-World Applications**: Modules culminated in projects like coding a web server in C++ and participating in a Supercell challenge to build a game using the SFML graphics library.

## Reflections and Takeaways

While I wouldnâ€™t say I have a single favorite module, I deeply value the knowledge and skills I gained through this journey. These projects taught me:
- How to organize and structure code effectively using object-oriented principles
- Exploring and finding my coding style for maintainable and scalable design
- The joy of tackling complex problems and transforming ideas into functioning systems

These modules prepared me to undertake larger projects with confidence, blending theory with practical implementation.
